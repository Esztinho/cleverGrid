# 1.18 One-Person Logical Game

 

Project Description:
Aim of the game is to navigate a figure from the top-left corner (marked with "S") of a 8x8 grid to the bottom-right corner (marked with "C"). The figure must adhere to the following rules:

The figure can move vertically and horizontally within the grid.

Every move must involve displacing the figure by exactly 2 or 3 squares.

Initially, the figure must move 2 squares from the top-left corner.

During movement, the number of squares traversed by the figure alternates between 2 and 3. 

This change occurs when the figure lands on a circled square.

The figure cannot move onto dark squares.
